# Ideas
A list of features that might be useful, but for which I have no time and interest to actually implement them.

## Add type hints
mypy: http://mypy-lang.org/
flake8-typing-imports(?)
https://www.bernat.tech/the-state-of-type-hints-in-python/

## Improve documentation
- spellchecker? (sphinxcontrib.spelling is deprecated, but see cookiecutter-pylibrary for setup)
- Upload documentation to ReadTheDocs and extend README.md with badges and link to documentation
- Use a gallery page for the examples (like https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index)

## Publish on PyPi
Use twine (twine>=1.11.0 if readme in markdown), use `twine check` instead of `setup.py check`.
https://packaging.python.org/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme#validating-restructuredtext-markup

## More control of plot
- Draw trail behind balls (and control trail length)
- Improve CircleCollection.datalim (somehow rendering and `get_path_collection_extents` don't do the same thing with transform, transData and transOffset)
- Improve plotting of InfiniteWall: make width of hatching scale invariant and extend it indefinitely into the "inside" of the wall, see e.g. https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/angle_annotation.html

## More versatile `visualize.interact`
- Use mouse scroll wheel for zooming
- Draw balls as solid disks, use colors like matplotlib (but for dark mode?)
- Show/hide velocities as arrows starting at the balls center
- When paused drag-and-drop balls around and edit velocites by dragging-and-dropping the arrow tips

## Better Testing
- How to write proper tests for matplotlib?
- How to write proper tests for pyglet (or GUIs in general)?
- Make pyglet work with tox, currently I can't access `pyglet.gl.GL_LINES` when I run the tests via tox (pyglet.canvas.xlib.NoSuchDisplayException: Cannot connect to "None"), see commented fragments in test_visualize.py and the .model methods in obstacle.
- Use TravisCI (and other internet services?)

## More obstacles
Reference: DynamicalBilliards.jl
- Finite wall, but collision with the endpoints will be complicated (model ball-line collision like point-stadium collision)
- Rectangle, polygon (built from finite lines)
- Semicircle, Ellipse
- Quick access to standard billiard shapes (rectangle, stadium, ...)?
- In README.md write "Static obstacles to construct billiard tables with arbitrary shapes"

## Gravity
Make the balls fall "downwards" i.e.
- To Billiard.__init__ add gravity: np.ndarray of size 2
- In Billiard._move:
    self.balls_position += self.balls_velocity * dt + self.gravity / 2 * dt**2
    self.balls_velocity += self.gravity * dt
- Calculate time of impact for ball-ball collisions: don't change anything because all balls fall at the same rate (if we switch to frame of reference that accelerates with gravity, then the balls are not accelerated anymore. Thanks Einstein!)
- Calculate time of impact for ball-obstacle collisions: I dont't know, it might be complicated since obstacles remain stationary (i.e. accelerate in gravity-following frame of reference)

## (Sliding) Friction and/or drag
Imagine that the balls roll on a flat horizontal table covered in cloth (this will be inconsistent with gravity but that's OK.)
Friction is a force of size F = mu * mass with a direction opposite of velocity.
We need to integrate a = mu to find the trajectory of the ball until it stops (this is a straight line which is reparameterised by a quadratic function).
Drag is a force similar to friction, but F is proportional to velocity^2 * size of ball, this is more complicated to integrate.
We can still use time of impact calculation, but we need to take care of the reparameterisation.


# Misc
- Particles with no radius are point particles
- Particles with zero mass are massless and don't push others around
- Particles with infinite mass are not pushed around by other particles
- Obstacles always have an inside and an outside, collision happens only when a ball comes from the inside and moves towards the outside. This is because point particles on the obstacle
- Docstring style: https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html#example-google
- Billiards in Julia: https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalBilliards.jl/dev/
- Collision handling: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision#Two-dimensional_collision_with_two_moving_objects
- Use pipenv with tox? https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#tox-automation-project

## Unused commands
```shell
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
sphinx-apidoc -f -o {toxinidir}/docs/api_reference {toxinidir}/src/billiards
pandoc README.md --from markdown --to rst -s -o README.rst
```
